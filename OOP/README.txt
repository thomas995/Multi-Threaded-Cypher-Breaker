*This is the README file for the MultiThreaded Cypher Project.
*The aim of this project is to allow the user to input any text they want and have it displayed in RailFence
or a 'zigzag' format.
*This is so the traitorous outsiders can't read the hidden message.
*If only numbers are entered, then a message appears asking you to run the program again as numbers will not be encrpyted
*Once a phrase has been entered, you are given the option to press any key you want, this allows the program to read from the file(txtFile.txt)
*Once the key is entered, it displays the words in encrypted and decrypted form, while also displaying those words in the zigzag format
*Any phrase can also be added to the txtFile.txt by simply typing it out without spaces in the file
*All the code and files can be found in the OOP folder of the project and not in the MultiThreadedCypherProject which was created early on due to a pushing to GitHub problem.
